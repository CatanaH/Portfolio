# Who am I?
   Well, My name's Catana, yes named after the sword, but spelled differently. I am an avid learner of all things in this world, and programming is my pursuit. I started this adventure with Python and have since transitioned into more JavaScript and frontend development. I have loved it all and the list of what I want to learn has only grown longer. 
I learn whatever I need to complete a project in the way I envision it. Some may say this leads to distractions or unnessary learning tangents, but I think this is the best way to approach any subject. "You don't know what you dont know", so how can you know what you need before you start? You have to just go out there, experiment, and see what works, then learn everything you can to make it awesome!
    
 # What I've Accomplished:
- Simple websites, custom web applications, Basic mobile applications
- Git with GitHub
- code reviews, debugging and improvement
- Project management (With Jira)
- My current knowledge base consists of JavaScript (React Native, React.JS, NodeJS), Python (Django, DRF), HTML, CSS(flex-box). 
- I also have experience with other tools and toolkits. Feel free to ask me more about the languages or instruments that will be required for your project.
